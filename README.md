# Grazioso Salvare Rescue Animal Tracking Application

## Project Overview

This project is a part of the "Foundation in App Development" (IT 145) course. It involves modifying and enhancing a Java-based application designed for Grazioso Salvare, an international search-and-rescue animal training company. The application tracks and manages rescue animals, specifically dogs and monkeys, to aid in their rescue missions.

## Project work

Worked on two main tasks:

1. **Created the `Monkey` class**: This class inherits from the `RescueAnimal` class and include attributes specific to monkeys.
2. **Modified the `Driver` class**: This involves implementing and modifying methods for intake, reservation, and printing of animals, ensuring input validation and user interaction.

## Files Included

- **RescueAnimal.java**: Base class representing general attributes and behaviors of rescue animals.
- **Dog.java**: Class extending `RescueAnimal` with attributes specific to dogs.
- **Monkey.java**: Class extending `RescueAnimal` with additional attributes specific to monkeys (newly created).
- **Driver.java**: Main class containing the application's logic, including menu options for interacting with the animal lists.
